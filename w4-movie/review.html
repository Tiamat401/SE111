            <p><b>George Zapata</b> <i>8/18/20</i></p>
            <p>This movie is one of my favorite movies. I give this movie two thumbs up and 5 out of 5 stars. The reason I give this such a good rating is because you can watch this movie over and over and still enjoy it years later. The drama of going to jail over killing your lover with another man. To find out that you didnt even kill her and you were doing time for someone elses murder. Andy did find great friends that got him thorugh the tough times in prison. The warden tried to work him over and do his money laundring. After wanting a retrail he was forced to do 2 month's in solidation. <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> is a movie that is very entertaining for all audiences.
            </p>

            <p>Andy had to do more than 30 years a free man. After learning he will never be free living like a caged animal After preparing to escape for years and finally had the curage to escape. He escaped through a sewer drain that was the length of 5 football fields. The day of his escape he went to numorous banks in the Main buckston county. He stole more than two houndred and fifty thousand of the wardens money. Andy then made is way down to Mexico. He told Red if he ever made it out to go a heyfield in town of buckston and go along the stone wall to you see the old oak tree. There you will find something that does not belong there and I want you to have the contents that are placed there. After finding the contents that lay in the box Andy left for Red, he made his way down to Mexico to see his friend.

            <h3 class="info">Trivia</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>There’s now a Shawshank Trail for tourists, and local businesses are right on the bandwagon. In that part of Ohio you can pick yourself up some Reformatory “Red” Wines, Shawshank Bundt Cakes and the local Two Cousins’ Pizza sells Redemption pie.</li>

                <li>When Andy is making his escape, he crawls through a sewer tunnel filled with raw excrement. The sludge was actually a mixture of chocolate syrup, sawdust, and water, and even decades later the pipes still smell like cocoa.</li>

                <li>There are only two female speaking parts in the entire film. One is the customer who complains about Brooks’ service at the grocery store and the other is the bank teller who attends to Andy at the bank following his escape.</li>
